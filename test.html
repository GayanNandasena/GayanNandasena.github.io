            <p class="">I am passionate about blending technology with creativity. Alongside my studies, I am an aspiring 3D artist, specializing in product modeling and architectural visualization using Blender and 3ds Max.<br>
               <br>My technical expertise in software engineering is complemented by my creative pursuits in 3D art, allowing me to approach problems with a unique perspective. I am dedicated to continuous learning and look forward to expanding my skill set further through both academic and practical experiences.<br>
               <br>I am always open to connecting with fellow professionals, sharing knowledge, and exploring new opportunities in both software engineering and 3D art.
